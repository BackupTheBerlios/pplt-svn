For edef-core:
    * Disign and implement an assembly Object, that will be renerated by the 
      an XML file that describes how to assemble modules and other assemblies 
      to create a new module. An assembly should look and feel like a "normal"
      module. 
    
    * Implement DTD or XML-Scheme validation of modules and assemblies.
    
    * Referecres to inputs in the event-queue of EventManager should be 
      weak-refs. Because; if the an instance that owns the input is 
      destroyed the instance will be alife until the event is processed!
      With weak-refs the instance will be immediatly destroyed and events
      submitted to it were no processed.
