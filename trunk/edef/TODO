= TODO for release 0.2dev =
    * Add a logger-window
	* schema validation for edef/ModuleMeta.py and all models of edef-dev

= TODO for release 0.3dev =
	* type stuff for edef-dev/circuit	
	
= TODO for release 0.4dev =
	* dynamic IOs for edef-dev/circuit
	
	
= Things to be done =

    == Tasks for edef-core ==
        * Implement DTD or XML-Scheme validation of modules and assemblies.
        * Check if there are some dead-locks in EventManager!

    == Tasks for edef-dev ==
        * All "models" should validate there data!
        * A module can specify a grafical representation as a python-class!
            - define an interface 
        * Improove the A* algorithm in edef-dev/circuit/Canvas.py! 
        * Write an Assembly-editor
        * Support dynamic inputs/outputs
        * types should be checked and represented grafical by color of the 
          wire
    


= Bugs =
    * There are sometimes import-errors while loading a module from an archive
      that was edited. Workaround: Restart edef-dev to get rid of import 
      errors.



= Long term tasks =
    * Add a component to check boolean modules by a value-table
    * rewrite edef/EventManager.py: it is an ungly, complex chunk of code!
    * Find and solve all FIXMEs
