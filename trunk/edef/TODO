== Tasks for edef-core ===
    * Implement DTD or XML-Scheme validation of modules and assemblies.
    * Check if there are some dead-locks in EventManager!


== Tasks for edef-dev ==
    * All "models" should validate threre data!
    * A module can specify a grafical representation as a python-class!
        - define an interface 
        - test if "normal" wxWindows can be placed into the canvas
    * Improove the A* algorithm in edef-dev/circuit/Canvas.py! 
    * Add a logger-window
    * Write an Assembly-editor
    * Support dynamic inputs/outputs
    

=== Bugs ===
    * There are sometimes import-errors while loading a module from an archive
      that was edited. Workaround: Restart edef-dev to get rid of import 
      errors.



= Long term tasks =
    * Add a component to check boolean modules by a value-table
    * rewrite edef/EventManager.py: it is an ungly, complex chunk of code!
    * Find and solve all FIXMEs
