For edef-core:
    * Design and implement an assembly Object, that will be generated by an 
      XML file that describes how to assemble modules and/or other assemblies
      to create a new module. An assembly should look and feel like a "normal"
      module. 
    
    * Implement DTD or XML-Scheme validation of modules and assemblies.
