= Tasks for release 0.1 =
    This release should be nearly beta! So it should be more or less feature-
    complete. It should be possible to write modules simply using the 
    "edef-dev" application and to play around with the simulation-engine 
    unsing "edef-sim". Therefor there have to be the basic GUI stuff like
    saving the current session, ... 

    First of all the edef-core should be completed. Then the "edef-dev" and
    at the end the "edef-sim" application.

    * Write a simple "editor" for edef-modules. Incuding a python editor for 
      module-code and a wizzard to create/edit the description files. 
      Features:
        - create/delete archives
        - create/edit/delete code files
        - create/edit/delete description-files

    * write a simple simulation environment. Using A* algorithm to route 
      "wires" between modules. Some simple IO widgets like buttons, lamps,
      text-fields. The application should have a xml-format to save and load
      old sessions. 

    * All bases on a stabile simulation framework "edef-core". Means that it 
      have to be well tested.



=== Tasks for edef-core ===
    * Implement DTD or XML-Scheme validation of modules and assemblies.
    * Test new EventManager features!

=== Tasks for edef-dev ===
    * Create mask to edit/create a module-description. This mask should be 
      shown instead of an editor tab inside edef-dev. 
    * Make it possible to cretate/delete archives.
    * Make the editor configurable. (Only basic stuff like; tabs, fonts, ...)

=== Tasks for edef-sim === (the simulation env.)
    * Write it.




= Long term tasks =
    * rewrite edef/EventManager.py: it is an ungly, complex chunk of code!
    * Do all the stuff above...
