= Tasks for release 0.1 =
    This release should be nearly beta! So it should be more or less feature-
    complete. It should be possible to write modules simply using the 
    "edef-dev" application and to play around with the simulation-engine 
    unsing "edef-sim". Therefor there have to be the basic GUI stuff like
    saving the current session, ... 

    First of all the edef-core should be completed. Then the "edef-dev" and
    at the end the "edef-sim" application.

    * All bases on a stabile simulation framework "edef-core". Means that it 
      have to be well tested.



=== Tasks for edef-core ===
    * Implement DTD or XML-Scheme validation of modules and assemblies.
    * Check if there can be some dead-locks in EventManager!


=== Tasks for edef-dev ===
    * Make "editors" to be components -> an editor-comp, description-comp and
        later may be a circuit-comp (simulation)
        This does not make the edef-dev modular because the controller is 
        quite monolithic. 



= Long term tasks =
    * rewrite edef/EventManager.py: it is an ungly, complex chunk of code!
