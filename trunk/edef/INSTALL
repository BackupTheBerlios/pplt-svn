To install the edef library and applications simply call as root:

    > python setup.py install

There is an application called "edef-dev" (edef developer). You can develop 
new modules with this application easiely. Also it has a simulation component
to build circuits.


Dependencies:
=============
    * pyXML         - Used to parse the meta-data of modules.
    * wxPython 2.8  - The GUI library. Only needed if you want to use the 
                      edef-dev application.

    Maybe some modules will need additional python-libraries.
