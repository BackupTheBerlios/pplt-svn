This package contains a sample JVisu (http://jvisu.com) server. This server
takes an pplt assembly and serve all its variables a JVisu applet or client.

The usage is quite simply. Call:

    pplt_jvs [options] assembly [--parameter=value, ... ]

    The "assembly" specifies the name of the assembly to load. 
        Note: This server has the restiction only to load one assembly. So you 
        need to provide the complete configuration in one assembly. 

    The parameter=value pairs define the parameters for the assembly. You may 
    have to set the values into double-quotes. What parameters are available
    or needed depends on the assembly you want to load. 
        
    There is currently only one option for the JVisu-Server: 
        --port=PORT-NUMBER  This option specifies the number of the TCP port
                            the server will listen for new connections.
