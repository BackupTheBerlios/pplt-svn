This package contains a server-plugin for the lintouch (http://lintouch.org) 
framework.

To do this this package provides a C to python wrapper to write server-plugins
using python. Additional there is a python plugin that enables you to load ONE
pplt-assembly. The lintouch plugin will provide all defined addresses of the 
assembly as variables to the lintouch server. 

I hope that the general python server-plugin will be joined into the lintouch
project.
