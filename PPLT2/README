 === This the the Potsdamer Prozessleittechnik (PPLT) Two ===

 This version differs form in be written in C++ instead of Python. But there 
 is (will be) a python port. The main feature to be a framework for master 
 slave based communication was extended to handle events. So it can be used
 i a multi master environment. 

 == Requirements ==
 At first you'll need a C++ compiler and the Qt-Core library to compile the 
 core library. To get a GUI you'll also need the complete Qt framework.

 To use python modules you'll need the python development packages.
