 === This the the Potsdamer Prozessleittechnik (PPLT) Two ===

 This version differs form in be written in C++ instead of Python. But there 
 is (will be) a python port. The main feature to be a framework for master 
 slave based communication was extended to handle events. So it can be used
 i a multi master environment. 

 == Requirements ==
    - An common C++ compiler (ie. GCC).
    - The wxWindows library also for potability reasons.
      So you have to have the wx installed even if you onyl want to use the 
      PPLTCore library!
    - Bakefile (http://bakefile.sf.net) To create the make- or project-files 
      to complile the PPLT. Note that bakefile also have some depencies!
    - The wxXML2 extention is used to get an platform independed interface to 
      an XML parser. This is not reconmented if you complile only the PPLTCore.
