 + Implement a "assembly" class that holds several modules to an instance that
   provide a CModule like interface. Modify CImporter so that it can load this
   assemblies. The target is that a user should not need to know if he loads a
   "normal" module or an assembly ob several modules. 

 + Finish the value-connection and module and write some tests!
