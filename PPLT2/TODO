 === Module description language ===
    + develop and implement a module description language
   
 === Python stuff ===
    + design a python package that wraps the pplt-core
    + build a pyModuleLoader that can load modules that are
      written in python.

 === monoModuleLoader ===
    + design a mono (C#) library that wraps the pplt-core.
    + also build a mono module loader to load modules written
      in C# or so...

 === Port to wxWindows ===
    + even if it is not so portable like qtCore, I want to port the PPLT to
      the wxWindows platform. Becaus this platfor provides a better
      integration into other projects. (This library lets the PPLT keep an
      simple library)
