+++ general Tasks +++
[ALL]
	Do testing and testing and testing

[pyDCPU]
	Implement mounting of a remote symbol tree 
	maybe by using simple export (XML-RPC)
	(maybe very complex -> a task for 
	release 1.1.0)



+++ BUGs BUGs BUGs +++
[ALL]
	Check all try/except brackets for a usefull debug or error 
	output. (i know, that i was lasy)

[CoreModule] 
	PPLTWeb and JVisu eat all free CPU load. (SimpleExport doesn't, may be 
	a problem with the non-blocking sockets.)

[CoreModule]	
	If stoping the PPLTWebServer an exception will be raised 
	(maybe JVisuServer has the same problem)

[pyDCPU]
	It would be better if the call of setup() of a module will be inside 
	a try/except pair.

[PPLTCenter]
	All dialoges should associate ENTER with OK-click.

[pyDCPU]
	Symbols/Folders should be raname-able.
