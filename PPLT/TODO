[pyDCPU]
    - It would be better if the call of setup() of a module will be inside 
      a try/except pair.

    - Symbolslots should keep there cached values if a error appears
    
    - Can create more than one user proxy for one user in the same group.
	
    - Implement module-compileing


[PPLTCenter]
    - SymbolTreePanel: Make all visible items visible after rebuild tree.

    - SymbolTreePanel: Edit symbol or server-name is not cancelable under 
      Win2000 but under Win98

    - Fix filetypes in all fileselection-dialogs. (maybe fix translation)
