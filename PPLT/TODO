+++ general Tasks +++
[ALL]
	Do testing and testing and testing

[pyDCPU]
	Implement mounting of a remote symbol tree 
	maybe by using simple export (XML-RPC)
	(maybe very complex -> a task for 
	release 1.1.0)

[pyDCPU]
	Implement user-proxy into the user/group
	system to proxy a user into an other 
	group.



+++ BUGs BUGs BUGs +++
[ALL]
	Check all try/except brackets for a usefull debug or error 
	output. (i know that i was lasy)

[CoreModule] 
	PPLTWeb and JVisu eat all free CPU load. (SimpleExport doesn't, may be 
	a problem with the non-blocking sockets.)

[CoreModule]	
	If stoping the PPLTWebServer an exception will be raised 
	(maybe JVisuServer has the same problem)

[PPLTCenter]
	If there is no description for a device or slot the description-window
	should be cleaned.

[pyDCPU]
	It would be better if the call of setup() of a module will be inside 
	a try/except pair.
