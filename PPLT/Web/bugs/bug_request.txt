Serious:
    By default everyone can read the files in /xml.
    
    By default is is easy to access the users.xml by requesting
    http://www.example-host.com/codetrack/xml/users.xml. 

    I don't know if it is a serious security problem but it isn't 
    nice.

    A simple work-around for the Apache web-server could be to 
    add a .htaccess file to this and optional to the backup/ 
    directory. The .htaccess file should contain:
----
Order Deny,Allow
Deny from all
----


Feature:
    Anonymous account?

    Would it be possible to create a anonymous (Guest) account
    so that someone can post new issues without getting his own 
    account?


Feature:
    Translation to other languages?

    Would it be possible to translate codetrack to other languages?
    (May be with gettext()?)
    I would do the German translation if you want to do.
