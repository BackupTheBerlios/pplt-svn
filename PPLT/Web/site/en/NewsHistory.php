	<b>2005-08-20 - Bug-fix Release of PPLT Version 0.3.1</b><br>
	I've done a lot of testing and debugging. Also I've wrote
	a post-install script for the windows-installer, that creates
	a folder in the start menu.<br>
	<u>Please update!</u><br><br> 
	<b>2005-08-20 - Release of PPLT Version 0.3.0</b><br>
	I've done a lot of debugging and (sometimes) rewriting
	wide parts of the PPLT library. Will stop now developing
	to focus on debugging to reach the stable state.
	<u>Note:</u> Please also update the Modules!<br><br>
	<b>2005-06-03 - Release of PPLT Version 0.2.2</b><br>

	some bugs and the German translation of PPLTC.<br><br>

	<b>2005-05-27 - 2nd Alpharelease of PPLT(Version 0.2.0)</b><br>
	I've released the 2nd alpha version of PPLT. The major change is the new
	GUI application PPLT Center (PPLTC.py) that shows the functionality of
	the library. Also some bugs are fixed.<br><br>
    <b>2005-05-10 - Alpharelease of PPLT (Version 0.1.0)</b><br>

    <b>2005-04-28 - Release PPLT version 0.1pre3</b><br>
	This release is nearly the same like <i>0.1pre2</i>
	but I've removed some ugly bugs.<br><br>
	<b>2005-04-25 - Release PPLT version 0.1pre2</b><br>
	I've released a second prealpha version of the PPLT library.

	to load and manage devices and servers.<br><br>

            title="Link to released files.">released</a>
    a prealpha version of the PPLT library. The
    <span title="This core library is called pyDCPU">Core-Library</span> is
    quite usable but the abstraction-layer is completely missing.
