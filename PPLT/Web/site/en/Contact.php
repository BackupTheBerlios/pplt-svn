		To continue the developing, I need your help. Your support in any kind is welcome.<br>
		You don't need to be a member of this project to improve PPLT. Even if you tell me about
		mistakes in this web-page or in the applications will improve the quality.

		<p>Please feel free to ask me anything (related to this project). So I can assess what
		I need to document.</p>

		<p>
		To improve the quality of PPLT I need information about the problems you have with it.
		Please send me an e-mail or write a 
		<a href="https://developer.berlios.de/bugs/?func=addbug&group_id=3237">bug-report</a> and
		describe the problem. Please add the version of PPLT and the name of the platform
		you use.
