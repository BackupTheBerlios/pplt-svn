               <p>In this page I will give you a (realy) short intoduction into the PPLT concept,
               if you want ot known more, please follow the links in this text.

            <div class="Head">Main Goals</div>
            <div class="Text">
               The main goal was to have a flexible, modular and platform-independent system,
               that grap information from many different systems over differen interfaces
               meaning controlers and <i>intelligent</i> sensors and manage them together in one,
               so called, <i>Symbol-Tree</i>.

               <p>The second goal was to have a own user and group management to control the
               access to this central Symbol-Tree.</p>

               <p>At least it should be able to export this symbols to other sysmtems by
               modules. So it is not bound to a single visualiziation.</p>
            </div>



            <div class="Head">Disign</div>
            <div class="Text">
            You can split the PPLT system into 3 parts.
            
            <p style="text-align:center"><img src="/img/BasicConcept.png" alt="" title="Basic Concept"></p>
            <p>One part imports information and data from systems for example from controlers
            or sensors. This part is a little bit difficault to use, bacause you have to handle
            with a lot of modules to get information from a controler. You need for example
            a module for the interface, the BUS protocol and one for the command-messageformat
            to read out values of a markers in a controller. But this is a main goal of this
            project because you only need to replace the interface and protocol modules to
            talk to the same controller over an other BUS-system. This makes this system very
            flexible.</p>

            <p>The other part manage this imported information into a file-system like
            <i>Symbol-Tree</i>. Imagine this Tree as a small file-system with folders and files.
            Each file (called <i>symbol</i>) represent for example a marker into a controller or
            the actual value of a sensor. To manage them better, if you have many of them, there are
            folders. This Symbol-Tree have also (like file-systems) a right-managment. This means
            you can define permissions to a spezific symbol or folder for other users and groups.</p>


            <p>The last part exports this symboltree to other systems, like visualisations or
            databases. This export-part also work with modules, so it is possible to process
            the information in the symbol-tree in a many applications (if there are implemented
            with a module). For example there is a module which use <a href="SimpleExport.html">XML-RPC</a>
            to export this symbols for other applications.</p>

            But the best of all is, it was written in Python.


            <div class="Head">Supported (Implemented) Hardware<div>
            <div class="Text">
               I will give you a list of Hardware, mostly Controler, i tested
               with PPLT. It may be possible that more will work because it 
               hardly depends on the constellation of the used modules.
               <ul>
                  <li><b>NAIS FP0/FP2</b> - I tested them over the ToolPort. It was
                  also possible to access them over the tunneled ToolPort of an
                  <b>NAIS Web-Server</b>.

                  <li><b>NAIS A200</b> - This is an industrial image-checker. To
                  access it i used the build in RS232 port.

                  <li><b>Siemens SIMATIC S7-200</b> - I used the PPI-Cable in
                  <i>FreePort</i> mode.

                  <li><b>Siemens S55</b> mobile phone. I am sure that other GSM
                  compatible mobile phones will also work fine.
               </ul>

            <div class="Head">Future</div>
            <div class="Text">
               At first i planed to reach the stabile state.

               <p>In the next future i will provide a usabe documentation.</p>

               <p>I also planed to add a new module-path to the core libary so the
               system will be able to react on requests of controlers.</p>

               <p>But to reach this i need <u>help</u> i study physics at the university
               of Potsdam. It is hard to do booth, studieing physics and developing
               open source software at the same time. So if you are intrested, contact
               me. (please)</p>
