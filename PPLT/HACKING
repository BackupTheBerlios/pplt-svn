In this file I will comment the concepts of the PPLT system parts. This will 
never be an complete documentation. For more information look at the Core-Docs
or at pplt.berlios.de.


I.) Core


I.1) Master-Tree


I.1.1) Master-Object Locking
    There are two types of Object locking. The access-lock, to prevent 
    simultaneous access to a Master-Object and the remove-lock, to prevent the
    destruction of an used Master-Object.
    ALL LOCKING WILL BE DONE BY THE CONNECTION-OBJECT (access-lock) OR BY THE CORE (remove-lock)!


I.1.1.a) Access lock:    
    1.) Connection checks if Parent is locked
    1.1) If it is locked: 
            -> raise ItemBusy exception
    1.2) Else: 
            -> lock parent

    2.) access (read/write) to/from Parent
    3.) Anyway: UNLOCK PARENT even an exception is raised! 
    (4.) return value)
    

I.1.1.b) Remove lock:
    Each Master-Object handles a kind of usage counter, that counts the 
    number of open connections to the object. You can only remove an 
    Master-Object if this counter reaches zero! By this, you're unable to 
    remove objects, that are used by other modules or symbols.
    
    If you write a new Core-Module, you don't have to care about this counter.
    The counter will be inc/dec by the inc_usage() and dec_usage() methods.
    Please don't overload this methods unless you really know what you're 
    doing!
