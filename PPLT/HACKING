In this file I will comment the conecpts of the PPLT system parts. This will 
never be an complete documentation. For more information look at the Core-Docs
or at pplt.berlios.de.


I.) Core


I.1) MasterTree


I.1.1) MasterObeject Locking
    There are two types of Object locking. The access-lock, to prevent 
    simultan access to a MasterObject and the remove-lock, to prevent the
    destruction of an used MasterObject.
    ALL LOCKING WILL BE DONE BY THE CONNECTION-OBJECT (access-lock) OR BY THE CORE (remove-lock)!


I.1.1.a) Access lock:    
    1.) Connection checks if Parent is locked
    1.1) If it is locked: 
            -> raise ItemBusy exception
    1.2) Else: 
            -> lock parent

    2.) access (read/write) to/from Parent
    3.) Anyway: UNLOCK PARENT even an exception is reased! 
    (4.) return value)
    

I.1.1.b) Remove lock:
    Eeach MasterObject handles a kind of useage counter, that counts the 
    number of open connections to the object. You can only remove an 
    MasterObject if this counter reaches zero! By this, you're unable to 
    remove objects, that are used by other modules or symbols.
    
    If you write a new CoreModule, you don't have to care about this counter.
    The counter will be inc/dec by the inc_usage() and dec_usage() methods.
    Please don't overload this methods unless you realy know what you're 
    doing!
