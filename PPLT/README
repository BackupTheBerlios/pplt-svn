= ============================================================================ =

The PPLT is a framework for master-slave communication. An interface between 
devices (like PLCs) and applications like visualisations. 

INSTALL:
========
At first you need the Python interpreter version >= 2.3.0. You can get it
from http://www.python.org.

Also you need some python-libraries. You need wxPython version >= 2.5.0 if you 
want to use the GUI application "PPLT Center". You can get wxPaython from
http://www.wxpython.org. If you want to run the PPLT under Windows you'll
need the pywin32 extention (build 208). You can download pywin32 from
http://pywin32.sourceforge.net. Please check if the version of pywin32 fits to
your Python version. But if you use a Posix OS you'll don't need this 
extention.

Note: Some plugins (here called: modules) need additional libraries. So you
should get and install the pyserial library from 
http://pyserial.sourceforge.net to get all modules, useing the serial 
interface, running.

Now you should install the modules/software in following order:
	1.) Python
	2.) wxPython
	3.) pywin32-extention
	4.) pyserial
	5.) PPLT

To install a module you should unpack it and call:
	> python setup.py install
For more information please look at the "Installing Python Modules" section
of the Python documentation or at the README/INSTALL files of the specific
library.
